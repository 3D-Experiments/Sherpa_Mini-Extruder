![Image of V0 Toolhead](./Images/sherpa_mini_v0_toolhead_a2.png)

This is Alpha 2 release of the V0 toolhead to mount the Sherpa Mini Extruder as a direct drive extruder. Compared to the Alpha 1, the changes in this release are:

- Reduced frontage of toolhead which reduced plastic use by about ~6g.
- Widened wire routing channels on both sides at the back.
- More ziptie mounts on both sides for wiring convenience.
- New focussed cooling fan duct that should direct airflow closer to nozzle. (**NOTE: Untested and experimental**)

Stock fan ducts are available and the CAD files for the toolhead has been included if you wish to tinker with it. For the length of the bowden tube between the sherpa mini and the hotend, use the following lengths as a starting point:

- V6 Threaded: **41mm**
- Mosquito: **25mm**
- Dragon: **26mm**

You will need a [Sherpa Mini](../) and its parts can be found in our [sourcing guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O3eyVuQ6M4F03MJSDs4Z71_XyNjXL5HFTZr1jsaAtRc/htmlview#). It reuses all the same fasteners and parts from the original V0 toolhead with exception of the following extra parts:

- 2x Heatset inserts (3x5x4mm)
