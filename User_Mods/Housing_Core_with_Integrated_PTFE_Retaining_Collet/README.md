# Housing Core with Integrated PTFE Retaining Collet

This is a modification of the housing core *revision 4*, namely *housing_core_x1_rev4.STL* mesh, that adds an integrated PTFE retaining collet for a more simple PTFE tube handling.

The modification is designed around a collet like the E3D ones, see picture below.

**It has not been tested yet**.
