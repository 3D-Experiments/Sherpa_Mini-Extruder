# V2.2 Toolhead for Sherpa Mini - Release 1

This is a toolhead and X carriage for the Sherpa Mini Extruder based off the original V2.2 design. It is a dual rail variant. It has been tested to fit in V2.2 gantry; in CAD, it just fits in a V2.4/V1.8 assembly and you will need to check accordingly if the blower fans may interfere with the xy joints in your printer build.

Currently, it supports the Dragon Hotend only. Probe options include the Omron probe and the Magnetic Microswitch probe from Annex. There is also an option that is compatible with Denali/V1.8 gantry; you need only choose and print the right X carriage for these printers.
